# Issue Triage Guide

This guide describes how to triage GitHub issues on the [issue queue](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues) for Open Service Mesh (OSM).

## Steps for Traige
1. Identify the cause of the issue as explained below
2. Tag the issue with relevant tags
3. Assign the issue
4. Prioritize the issue with a P1, P2 or P3 label where:
    - P1: product cannot ship. Should be addressed as soon as possible. Eg: high priority bug
    - P2: Product cannot ship, but it does not need to be addressed immediately. Eg: high priority feature, lower priority bug
    - P3: Resolution of the work item is optional based on resources, time, and risk. Eg: a nice to have feature
5. Size the issue and assign it to a milestone:
    [WIP]
6. If you don't have time to resolve it, put links to the code to where you see the problem arising
7. Assign the issue to someone


## Identifying the cause of the issue
- If it's a bug: 
    - Reproduce the issue to make sure it is an actual issue
    - Tag it with the `bug` label
    - If possible, fix it or else reference links to the code 

- If it's a question: 
    - Ask around, go through docs, etc.
    - Respond to the question
    - Label appropriately

- Feature request 
    - Ask/understand the use cases
    - Tag it with the `Improvement/Feature Request` label and add other appropriate labels
