A documentation website for the [OSM](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/) project - [docs.openservicemesh.io](https://docs.openservicemesh.io)

# Editing Content

docs.openservicemesh.io is a static site. The documentation content needs to be located at `docs/content/docs/`.

To ensure the docs content renders correctly in the theme, each page will need to have [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) metadata. Example front matter:

```
---
title: "Docs Home"
linkTitle: "Home"
description: "OSM Docs Home"
weight: 1
type: docs
---
```

## Front Matter Notes:

* inclusion of `type: docs` is important for the theme to properly index the site contents
* the `linkTitle` attribute allows you to simplify the name as it appears in the left-side nav bar - ideally it should be short and clear - whereas the title can handle longform names for pages/documents.

## Versioning the Docs Site

When a new OSM release is cut, the docs site should be updated to reflect the version change. The underlying Docsy theme has versioning support built-in.

## Release and Versioning Process:

1. Create an archive of the current `main` branch, following the naming convention used by [prior releases](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/branches). Push this archival branch to `upstream`.

2. Once a release version branch is pushed to `upstream`, Netlify will build and deploy the documentation found within that branch. Within a couple of minutes of the branch push, the version of the site should be accessible at `https://<BRANCHNAME>--osm-docs.netlify.app/`

Test the url for the branch once deployed to ensure it is working.

3. Update the site version menu to reflect the changes

The version dropdown menu in set in the sites' `config.toml` (L73) file - adding a new `params.versions` archival entry for the prior release/branch, using the url from Netlify. The current release at the top of the list should reflect (i) the new version and (ii) the primary docs website url.

Example _(where v5 is new and v4 is now an archival prior release):_

```
[[params.versions]]
  version = "v0.5"
  url = "https://docs.openservicemesh.io"

[[params.versions]]
  version = "v0.4"
  url = "https://release-v0.4--osm-docs.netlify.app"
```

See [the Doscy versioning docs](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/versioning/) for more information on these theme config parameters.

> Note: the versioning controls are forward-facing only due to the nature of git branch history. The documentation website and netlify build process was added after `release-v0.4`, so only future releases will be deployed in this manner. The first release to be properly archived in this way will be `release-v0.5`. Trying to access archival urls for earlier versions (0.1 to 0.4) will not work because they predate this documentation website.



# Site Development

## Notes

* built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator
* custom theme uses [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) as a base, with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the underlying css framework and some [OSM custom sass](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/pull/1840/files#diff-374e78d353e95d66afe7e6c3e13de4aab370ffb117f32aeac519b15c2cbd057aR1)
* deployed to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osm-docs/deploys) via merges to main. (@flynnduism can grant additional access to account)
* metrics tracked via Google Analytics

## Install dependencies:

* Hugo [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
* packages are installed by running `yarn`

## Run the site:

```
// rebuild the site (to compile latest css/js)
hugo

// or serve the site for local dev
hugo serve
```

## Deploying the site:

The site auto deploys the main branch via [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osm-docs). Once pull requests are merged the changes will appear at docs.openservicemesh.io after a couple of minutes. Check the [logs](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osm-docs/deploys) for details.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8c8b7b52-b87f-42e0-949a-a784c3ca6d9a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/osm-docs/deploys)

`hugo serve` will run the site locally at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/)
