## Overview

Implementing [health probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) in your application is a great way for Kubernetes to automate some tasks to improve availability in the event of an error.

Because OSM reconfigures application Pods to redirect all incoming and outgoing network traffic through the proxy sidecar, `httpGet` and `tcpSocket` health probes invoked by the kubelet will fail due to the lack of any mTLS context required by the proxy.

For health probes to continue to work as expected from within the mesh, OSM adds configuration to expose the probe endpoint via the proxy and rewrites the probe definitions for new Pods to refer to the proxy-exposed endpoint. All of the functionality of the original probe is still used, OSM simply fronts it with the proxy so the kubelet can communicate with it.

For HTTP probes, the following table shows the modified path and port for each probe type.

Probe | Path | Port
-|-|-
Liveness | /osm-liveness-probe | 15901
Readiness | /osm-readiness-probe | 15902
Startup | /osm-startup-probe | 15903

HTTPS and `tcpSocket` probes will have their ports modified the same way as HTTP probes. For HTTPS probes, the path is left unchanged.

Only predefined `httpGet` and `tcpSocket` probes are modified. If a probe is undefined, one will not be added in its place. `exec` probes (including those using `grpc_health_probe`) are never modified and will continue to function as expected as long as the command does not require network access outside of `localhost`.

## Examples

The following examples show how OSM handles health probes for Pods in a mesh.

### HTTP

Consider a Pod spec defining a container with the following `livenessProbe`:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /liveness
    port: 14001
    scheme: HTTP
```

When the Pod is created, OSM will modify the probe to be the following:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /osm-liveness-probe
    port: 15901
    scheme: HTTP
```

The Pod's proxy will contain the following Envoy configuration.

An Envoy cluster which maps to the original probe port 14001:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster",
    "name": "liveness_cluster",
    "type": "STATIC",
    "connect_timeout": "1s",
    "load_assignment": {
      "cluster_name": "liveness_cluster",
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "lb_endpoints": [
            {
              "endpoint": {
                "address": {
                  "socket_address": {
                    "address": "0.0.0.0",
                    "port_value": 14001
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2021-03-29T21:02:59.086Z"
}
```

A listener for the new proxy-exposed HTTP endpoint at `/osm-liveness-probe` on port 15901 mapping to the cluster above:

                        }
                      }
                    ]
                  }

    ]
  },

}
```

### HTTPS

Consider a Pod spec defining a container with the following `livenessProbe`:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /liveness
    port: 14001
    scheme: HTTPS
```

When the Pod is created, OSM will modify the probe to be the following:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /liveness
    port: 15901
    scheme: HTTPS
```

The Pod's proxy will contain the following Envoy configuration.

An Envoy cluster which maps to the original probe port 14001:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster",
    "name": "liveness_cluster",
    "type": "STATIC",
    "connect_timeout": "1s",
    "load_assignment": {
      "cluster_name": "liveness_cluster",
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "lb_endpoints": [
            {
              "endpoint": {
                "address": {
                  "socket_address": {
                    "address": "0.0.0.0",
                    "port_value": 14001
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2021-03-29T21:02:59.086Z"
}
```

A listener for the new proxy-exposed TCP endpoint on port 15901 mapping to the cluster above:

```json
{
  "listener": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.listener.v3.Listener",
    "name": "liveness_listener",
    "address": {
      "socket_address": {
        "address": "0.0.0.0",

      }
    ]
  },
  "last_updated": "2021-04-07T15:09:22.704Z"
}
```

### `tcpSocket`

Consider a Pod spec defining a container with the following `livenessProbe`:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 14001
```

When the Pod is created, OSM will modify the probe to be the following:

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 15901
```

The Pod's proxy will contain the following Envoy configuration.

An Envoy cluster which maps to the original probe port 14001:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.config.cluster.v3.Cluster",
    "name": "liveness_cluster",
    "type": "STATIC",
    "connect_timeout": "1s",
    "load_assignment": {

                    "address": "0.0.0.0",
                    "port_value": 14001
                  }
                }
              }

    ]
  },

}
```

## How to Verify Health of Pods in the Mesh

Kubernetes will automatically poll the health endpoints of Pods configured with startup, liveness, and readiness probes.

When a startup probe fails, Kubernetes will generate an Event (visible by `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`) and restart the Pod. The `kubectl describe` output may look like this:

```
...
Events:
  Type     Reason     Age              From               Message

  Warning  Unhealthy  3s (x2 over 8s)  kubelet            Startup probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
```

When a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will generate an Event (visible by `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`) and restart the Pod. The `kubectl describe` output may look like this:

```
...
Events:
  Type     Reason     Age                From               Message

  Normal   Killing    32s (x2 over 44s)  kubelet            Container bookstore-v1 failed liveness probe, will be restarted
```

When a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will generate an Event (visible with `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`) and ensure no traffic destined for Services the Pod may be backing is routed to the unhealthy Pod. The `kubectl describe` output for a Pod with a failing readiness probe may look like this:

```
...
Events:
  Type     Reason     Age               From               Message

  Warning  Unhealthy  0s (x3 over 20s)  kubelet            Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
```

The Pod's `status` will also indicate that it is not ready which is shown in its `kubectl get pod` output. For example:

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bookstore-v1-5848999cb6-hp6qg   1/2     Running   0          85s
```

The Pods' health probes may also be invoked manually by forwarding the Pod's necessary port and using `curl` or any other HTTP client to issue requests. For example, to verify the liveness probe for the bookstore-v1 demo Pod, forward port 15901:

```
kubectl port-forward -n bookstore deployment/bookstore-v1 15901
```

Then, in a separate terminal instance, `curl` may be used to check the endpoint. The following example shows a healthy bookstore-v1:

```console
$ curl -i localhost:15901/osm-liveness-probe
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Known issues

- [#2207](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/issues/2207)

## Troubleshooting

If any health probes are consistently failing, perform the following steps to identify the root cause:

1. Verify `httpGet` and `tcpSocket` probes on Pods in the mesh have been modified.

    Startup, liveness, and readiness `httpGet` and `tcpSocket` probes must be modified by OSM in order to continue to function while in a mesh. Ports must be modified to 15901, 15902, and 15903 for liveness, readiness, and startup probes, respectively. Only HTTP (not HTTPS) probes will have paths modified in addition to be `/osm-liveness-probe`, `/osm-readiness-probe`, or `/osm-startup-probe`.

    Also, verify the Pod's Envoy configuration contains a listener for the modified endpoint.

    See the [examples above](#examples) for more details.

1. Determine if Kubernetes encountered any other errors while scheduling or starting the Pod.

    Look for any errors that may have recently occurred with `kubectl describe` of the unhealthy Pod. Resolve any errors and verify the Pod's health again.

1. Determine if the Pod encountered a runtime error.

    Look for any errors that may have occurred after the container started by inspecting its logs with `kubectl logs`. Resolve any errors and verify the Pod's health again.
