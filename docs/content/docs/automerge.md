OSM uses [Mergify](https://docs.mergify.io/) to automatically merge (automerge) and automatically rebase (autorebase) pull requests.

# Automerge
A pull request will be automerged via a merge commit if it meets the following criteria:
 - Has the `automerge` label
 - Does not have the `wip` label
 - Does not have the `do-not-merge/hold` label
 - Successfully completed all checks
 - Has at least 2 maintainer approvals
 - Base branch is either main or a release branch
If the pull request has an `automerge` label, the OSM-PR-bot will also autorebase the pull request if the PR branch goes out-of-date.
> Note: Currently, pull requests that are paths-ignore cannot be merged automatically.

# Autorebase
A pull request will be autorebased only and not automerged if it has the `autorebase` label. The rebase action will be completed by OSM-PR-bot.

# In Pull Request Comments
Some Mergify commands can also be triggered via comments on the pull request.
- `@Mergifyio refresh` will re-evaluate the rules
- `@Mergifyio rebase` will rebase this PR on its base branch
- `@Mergifyio backport <destination>` will [backport](https://docs.mergify.io/actions/backport.html) this PR on <destination> branch
