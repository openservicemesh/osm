# Tracing
Open Service Mesh (OSM) allows optional deployment of Jaeger for tracing. Similarly, tracing can be enabled and customized during installation (`tracing` section in `values.yaml`) or at runtime by editing the `osm-config` ConfigMap. Tracing can be enabled, disabled and configured at any time to support BYO scenarios.

## Jaeger
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open source tracing system used for monitoring and troubleshooting distributed systems. It can be deployed with OSM as a new instance or you may bring your own instance. 

### Automatic bring up
By default, Jaeger deployment and tracing as a whole is disabled.

Jaeger can be automatically deployed by using the `--deploy-jaeger` OSM CLI flag at install time or by toggling the `deployJaeger` value in `values.yaml`.


### BYO (Bring-your-own)
The following section documents the additional steps needed to allow an already running instance of Jaeger to integrate with your OSM control plane.
> NOTE: This guide outlines steps specifically for Jaeger but you may use your own tracing application instance with applicable values

#### Prerequisites
* A running Jaeger instance

The sections below outline how to make required updates depending on whether you already have a running instance of OSM or are installing OSM for the first time. In either case, the following `tracing` values in `values.yaml` are being updated to point to your Jaeger instance:
1. `enable`: set to `true` to tell the Envoy connection manager to send tracing data to a specific address (cluster)
1. `address`: set to the destination cluster of your Jaeger instance
1. `port`: set to the destination port for the listener that you intend to use
1. `endpoint`: set to the destination's API or collector endpoint where the spans will be sent to


#### Deploying Jaeger to a running instance of the OSM control plane

If you already have OSM running, `tracing` values must be updated in the OSM ConfigMap using:

```console
osm mesh upgrade --enable-tracing --tracing-address <tracing server hostname> --tracing-port <tracing server port> --tracing-endpoint <tracing server endpoint>
```
> NOTE : This command upgrades an OSM control plane configuration by upgrading the underlying Helm release. Any user-provided configuration could be reverted during future changes made using the OSM CLI so make sure to persist these changes whenever you use OSM CLI for installs or upgrades

You can verify these changes have been deployed by inspecting `osm-config`:
```console
kubectl get configmap osm-config -n osm-system -o yaml
```

#### Deploying Jaeger during OSM deployment

To deploy _your own instance of Jaeger_ during OSM installation, you can use the `--set` flag as shown below to update the values:

```console
osm install --set OpenServiceMesh.tracing.enable=true,OpenServiceMesh.tracing.address=<tracing server hostname>,OpenServiceMesh.tracing.port=<tracing server port>,OpenServiceMesh.tracing.endpoint=<tracing server endpoint>
```
