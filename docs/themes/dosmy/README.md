# DOSMy Theme

DOSMy is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for the Open Service Mesh project website.

DOSMy is based on an adaptation of [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) - an open source docs theme released by Google, which is built atop the [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (s)css framework.

## Prerequisites

1. Install a recent release of the Hugo "extended" version (we recommend version 0.53 or later). If you install from the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), make sure you download the `_extended` version which supports SCSS.
2. Install the dependencies (ideally using [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)). Run `yarn`
