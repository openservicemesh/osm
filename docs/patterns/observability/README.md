# Observability

OSM's observability stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for metrics visualization and Fluent Bit for log forwarding to a user-defined endpoint. These are disabled by default but may be enabled during OSM installation with flags `--deploy-prometheus`, `--deploy-grafana` and `--enable-fluentbit`.
