# Environments

OSM can be installed in any Kubernetes cluster running in a variety of environments such as AWS, Azure Kubernetes Service, Google Cloud, and even bare metal.

In the specific case of Azure Kubernetes Service, [a supported add-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/open-service-mesh-about) is provided by Microsoft to handle installation and configuration of OSM.
