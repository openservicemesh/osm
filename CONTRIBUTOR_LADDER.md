# OSM Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited to have you contribute to Open Service Mesh (OSM)! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilites and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things.
* "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do
* "Requirements" are qualifications a contributor needs to meet to be in that role
* "Privileges" are things a contributor on that level is entitled to


## Community Participant
Description: A Community Participant participates in the community and contributes their time, thoughts, etc.

* Responsibilities:
    * Must follow the [CNCF CoC](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
* How users can get involved with the community:
    * Participating in community discussions in Github, Slack, and meetings
    * Helping other users
    * Submitting bug reports
    * Trying out new releases
    * Attending community events
    * Talking about the project on social media, blogs, and talks


## Contributor

Description: A Contributor contributes directly to the project and adds value to it. Contributions need not be code. People at the Contributor level may be new contributors, or they may only contribute occasionally.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Following the [CNCF CoC](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
    * Following the project [contributing guide](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

    * Reports and sometimes resolves issues
    * Occasionally submits PRs
    * Contributes to the documentation
    * Regularly shows up at meetings, takes notes
    * Answers questions from other community members
    * Submits feedback on issues and PRs
    * Tests releases and patches and submits reviews
    * Runs or helps run events
    * Promotes the project in public
* Privileges:
    * Invitations to contributor events
    * Eligible to become a maintainer


## Maintainer

Description: Maintainers are very established contributors who are responsible for the entire project. As such, they have the ability to approve PRs against any area of the project, and are expected to participate in making decisions about the strategy and priorities of the project.

A Maintainer must meet the rights, responsiblities, and requirements of a Contributor, plus:

* Responsibilities include:
    * Following the reviewing guide
    * Reviewing and approving PRs that involve multiple parts of the project
    * Is supportive of new and infrequent contributors, and helps get useful PRs in shape to commit
    * Mentoring new Maintainers
    * Writing refactoring PRs
    * Participating in CNCF maintainer activities
    * Determining strategy and policy for the project
    * Participating in, and leading, community meetings
    * Helps run the project infrastructure
* Requirements
    * Experience as a Contributor for at least 3 months
    * Demonstrates a broad knowledge of the project across multiple areas
    * Is able to exercise judgement for the good of the project, independent of their employer, social circles, or teams
    * Mentors other Contributors
* Additional privileges:
    * Represent the project in public as a Maintainer
    * Communicate with the CNCF on behalf of the project
    * Have a vote in Maintainer decisions

Process of becoming a maintainer:

1. Any current Maintainer may nominate a current Contributor to become a new Maintainer, by opening a PR against the root of the [OSM repository](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm) and adding the nominee to the [OWNERS file](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/OWNERS). Additionally, if the nomination is for a code owner whose PR approvals are meant to satisfy the PR merge requirements, the nominee must be added to the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) in the same PR.
2. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
3. A majority of the current Maintainers must then approve the PR.


## Inactivity

It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than 3 months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than 3 months

* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status


## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilites and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated pattern of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the [CNCF CoC](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.


Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.


## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
