# OSM Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited to have you contribute to Open Service Mesh (OSM)! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up as their involvement in the project grows. Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the roles is organized into the following categories:
* "Responsibilities" list what the role is expected to do

    * Communicate with the CNCF on behalf of the project

Process of becoming a Maintainer:

1. A current contributor may be self-nominated or be nominated by a current Maintainer by opening a PR against the root of the [OSM repository] and adding the nominee to the [OWNERS file] under the *owners* entry. 
   - If the nomination is for a code owner whose PR approvals are meant to satisfy the PR merge requirements against specific areas of the codebase, the nominee must be added to the [CODEOWNERS file] for their specific areas of ownership in the same PR. 
   - A codeowner is defined per the [GitHub definition](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#about-code-owners). See this [example](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file) on how to specify an area in the [CODEOWNERS file] .
2. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
3. A majority of the current Maintainers must then approve the PR.


## Inactivity

It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than 3 months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than 3 months

* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status


## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a Maintainer happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended periods of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the [CNCF Code of Conduct]. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.


## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when a contributor's commitment level changes, they can consider one of the following options: 
1. Stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder)
2. Moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status or reducing your contributor level.


## Review Process

- In addition to self-nominated and Maintainer proposed nominations, Maintainers will meet quarterly to discuss Role promotions and demotions.
- Prior to nomination or meeting the requirements of the role, Contributors that express their interest in being a Maintainer can be assigned a Maintainer to help guide them through the requirements.
