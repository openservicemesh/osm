Open Service Mesh (OSM) is a lightweight, extensible, Cloud Native [service mesh][1] that allows users to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the-box observability features for highly dynamic microservice environments.

## Overview

OSM runs an Envoy based control plane on Kubernetes, can be configured with SMI APIs, and works by injecting an Envoy proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of your application. The proxy contains and executes rules around access control policies, implements routing configuration, and captures metrics. The control plane continually configures proxies to ensure policies and routing rules are up to date and ensures proxies are healthy.

### Core Principles
1. Simple to understand and contribute to
1. Effortless to install, maintain, and operate
1. Painless to troubleshoot
1. Easy to configure via [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)][2]

### Features

1. Easily and transparently configure [traffic shifting][3] for deployments
1. Secure service to service communication by [enabling mTLS](docs/patterns/certificates.md)
1. Define and execute fine grained [access control][4] policies for services
1. [Observability](docs/patterns/observability.md) and insights into application metrics for debugging and monitoring services
1. Integrate with [external certificate management](docs/patterns/certificates.md) services/solutions with a pluggable interface
1. Onboard applications onto the mesh by enabling [automatic sidecar injection](docs/patterns/sidecar_injection.md) of Envoy proxy

### SMI Specification support

|   Specification Component    |         Supported Release          |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------: |
| Traffic Access Control  |  [v1alpha2](/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha2/traffic-access.md)  |
| Traffic Specs  |  [v1alpha3](/apis/traffic-specs/v1alpha3/traffic-specs.md)  |

## OSM Design

Read more about [OSM's high level goals, design, and architecture](DESIGN.md).

## Getting Started

Below are quick getting started instructions. For a more detailed example usage guide and demo walkthrough, see the [OSM Example Usage Guide](/docs/example/README.md).

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster running Kubernetes v1.15.0 or greater
- kubectl current context is configured for the target cluster install
  - ```kubectl config current-context```

### Installation Demo

![OSM Install Demo](img/osm-install-demo.gif "OSM Install Demo")

### OSM CLI Install

The simplest way of installing Open Service Mesh on a Kubernetes cluster is by using the `osm` CLI.

Download the `osm` binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases). Unpack the `osm` binary and add it to `$PATH` to get started.
```shell
sudo mv ./osm /usr/local/bin/osm
```

#### Run Install Pre-flight Checks
```shell
$ osm check --pre-install
ok: initialize Kubernetes client
ok: query Kubernetes API
ok: Kubernetes version
ok: can create namespaces
ok: can create customresourcedefinitions
ok: can create clusterroles
ok: can create clusterrolebindings
ok: can create mutatingwebhookconfigurations
ok: can create serviceaccounts
ok: can create services
ok: can create deployments
ok: can create configmaps
ok: can read secrets
ok: can modify iptables
All checks successful!
```

#### Install OSM
```shell
$ osm install
```

See the [installation guide](docs/installation_guide.md) for more detailed options.

### Using OSM

After installing OSM, [onboard a microservice application](docs/onboard_services.md) to the service mesh.

### OSM Usage Patterns

1. [Ingress](docs/patterns/ingress.md) and [Egress](docs/patterns/egress.md)
1. [Observability](docs/patterns/observability.md)
1. [Certificates](docs/patterns/certificates.md)
1. [Sidecar Injection](docs/patterns/sidecar_injection.md)


## Demo and Examples

The [automated demo](demo/README.md) shows how OSM can manage, secure and provide observability for microservice environments.

To explore the same demo step by step, see the [example usage guide](/docs/example/README.md).
