Open Service Mesh (OSM) is a lightweight, extensible, cloud native [service mesh][1] that allows users to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the-box observability features for highly dynamic microservice environments.

The OSM project builds on the ideas and implementations of many cloud native ecosystem projects including [Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd), [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio), [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy), [Kuma](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma), [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), and the [SMI](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec) specification.

## Overview

OSM runs an Envoy based control plane on Kubernetes, can be configured with SMI APIs, and works by injecting an Envoy proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of your application. The proxy contains and executes rules around access control policies, implements routing configuration, and captures metrics. The control plane continually configures proxies to ensure policies and routing rules are up to date and ensures proxies are healthy.

### Core Principles

1. Simple to understand and contribute to
1. Effortless to install, maintain, and operate
1. Painless to troubleshoot
1. Easy to configure via [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)][2]

### Documentation

Documentation pertaining to the usage of Open Service Mesh is made available at [docs.openservicemesh.io](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/).

Documentation pertaining to development, release workflows, and other repository specific documentation, can be found in the [docs folder](/docs).

### Features

1. Easily and transparently configure [traffic shifting][3] for deployments
1. Secure service to service communication by [enabling mTLS](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/certificates/)
1. Define and execute fine grained [access control][4] policies for services
1. [Observability](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/troubleshooting/observability/) and insights into application metrics for debugging and monitoring services
1. Integrate with [external certificate management](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/certificates/) services/solutions with a pluggable interface
1. Onboard applications onto the mesh by enabling [automatic sidecar injection](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/sidecar_injection/) of Envoy proxy

## OSM Design

Read more about [OSM's high level goals, design, and architecture](DESIGN.md).

## Install

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster running an [active Kubernetes releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/). The range of supported Kubernetes versions is defined in the [OSM Helm chart](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/charts/osm/Chart.yaml#L24).
- kubectl current context is configured for the target cluster install
  - `kubectl config current-context`

### Get the OSM CLI

The simplest way of installing Open Service Mesh on a Kubernetes cluster is by using the `osm` CLI.

Download the `osm` binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases). Unpack the `osm` binary and add it to `$PATH` to get started.

```shell
sudo mv ./osm /usr/local/bin/osm
```

### Install OSM

```shell
$ osm install
```

![OSM Install Demo](img/osm-install-demo-v0.9.2.gif "OSM Install Demo")

See the [installation guide](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/install/) for more detailed options.

## Demonstration

The OSM [Bookstore demo](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/#deploy-applications) is a step-by-step walkthrough of how to install a bookbuyer and bookstore apps, and configure connectivity between these using SMI.

## Using OSM

After installing OSM, [onboard a microservice application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/) to the service mesh.

### OSM Usage Patterns

1. [Traffic Management](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/)
1. [Observability](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/troubleshooting/observability/)
1. [Certificates](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/certificates/)
1. [Sidecar Injection](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/sidecar_injection/)
