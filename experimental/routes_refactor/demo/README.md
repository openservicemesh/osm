### Create a Kubernetes cluster

```console
$ make kind-up
```

### Build OSM CLI

Install OSM control plane using the `osm` cli with the experimental routes v2 flag enabled
```console
$ bin/osm install --enable-routes-v2-experimental=true --container-registry "$CTR_REGISTRY" --osm-image-tag "$CTR_TAG" --osm-chart-path charts/osm
```

## Install Demo manifests

```console
$ bin/osm namespace add bookstore bookbuyer bookthief bookwarehouse
$ cd experimental/routes_refactor_demo/
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

## Verify Demo Successful

In `experimental/routes_refactor/demo/`:
```console
$ ./scripts/port-forward-all.sh
